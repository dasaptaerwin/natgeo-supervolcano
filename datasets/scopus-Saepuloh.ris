AB  - Identifying geological structures is a crucial step in geological field mapping. One common technique to interpret geological structures is using lineament analyses on the satellite imagery. The usual encounters is many lineaments do not concordance to the geological structures. Overcoming the problem, we used dual orbit Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to obtain lineaments related to geological structures at ground level. In this paper, we presented the sensitivity of the lineaments detection method visually and automatically using Yamaguchi and modified Segment Tracing Algorithm (mSTA) methods, respectively. The Yamaguchi method is a visual lineament detection using an optimum image-scale and resolution. The method was used to detect lineaments based on visual limitation of the interpreter. On the contrary, the mSTA method is an automatic lineament detection utilizing SAR backscattering intensity images in opposite Line of Sight (LOS). Accordingly, we compared the effectiveness between the visual and automatic detection methods in detecting the faults and joints correctly at ground surface. The verification of detected lineaments at the field was then performed and analyzed to obtain comparison of the effectiveness between two lineaments detection methods. The direction of joints at EKA-01 were oblique 45 degrees to Yamaguchi method, and 25 degrees to mSTA method. Besides, the direction of faults and joints at EKA-10 were oblique 5 degrees to Yamaguchi method, and 2 degrees to mSTA method. mSTA method has smaller offset angle to field measurements than Yamaguchi method, indicating that the automatic is more effective and representative to detect lineaments related to geological structures than visual method. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Upflow zone identification at volcanic fields is crucial for geothermal resource exploration. The common problem to identify the upflow zone using conventional mapping method is time-consuming and the limitation of access to the area. The application of satellite imaging as ground-truthing is aimed to increase the effectiveness of upflow zone detection at geothermal fields. This study selected the volcanic field around the Bandung Basin for a model case. The data used in this study were thermal images of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Thermal Infrared Radiometer (TIR) by the night observations. The TIR data were corrected and calibrated by Visible Near Infrared Radiometer (VNIR) to measure Land Surface Temperature (LST). We then focused our analysis around a volcanic area that showed high LST at the Papandayan crater and other manifestations. Validations were carried out by measuring surface temperature and gas concentrations including SO2 and CO2. The reading value of the gases was different on each location, but the pattern of the gases was relatively similar especially the SO2 gas pattern. The SO2 gas showed a relatively constant trend of gas concentration over time in the upflow zone, but in the outflow zone showed an increase pattern with the time whose reading values were lower than those on the upflow. On the contrary, the non-geothermal features showed that the SO2 concentration decreased with the time towards almost 0. According to the retrieved LST, the surface manifestations were located not only at the high anomaly but also at medium anomaly depending on the manifestation dimension. The gas and temperature measurements proved that LST could be used to enhance the effectiveness of upflow zone identification. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The limited nature of subsurface imaging data in geothermal field makes surface data important to infer subsurface geologic conditions. One of the main geologic features that can be extracted from surface data is lineament which can be attributed to rock fractures, including joints and deep-seated faults. Fractures play a dominant role in the creation of porosity and permeability that allows the storage and flow of thermal fluid in geothermal reservoirs. Therefore, it is important to characterize rock fractures and model the flow of thermal fluid through them to better understand the geothermal reservoir. This study evaluates the application of lineaments extracted from dual-orbit Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by the Phased-L Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) sensor on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) as input for fracture modeling to reservoir simulation in geothermal field. The SAR images were acquired from the Geureudong area in Aceh. Lineaments were extracted automatically from SAR images using modified Segment Tracing Algorithm (mSTA). Noise filtering and edge enhancement algorithms were applied to the SAR images prior to mSTA to optimize the extraction of geologically significant lineaments. The extracted lineaments were spatially analyzed, including lineament frequency density, lineament length density, lineament intersection density, and lineament direction rose diagram. Representative fracture model with a vertical dip angle was created from the extracted lineaments and was assigned with reservoir properties, including permeability and porosity. Thermal fluid flow was simulated through it to detect flow path and to characterize fluid flow in a geothermal system. Spatial analysis of the extracted lineaments showed a good correlation with the trend of geological structures observed in the field. The simulated fluid flow path showed good agreement with the spatial distribution of geothermal manifestations. Simulation results showed a strong correlation between fluid flow characteristics to the orientation, density, and connectivity of the fracture model. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We estimate the maximum magnitude scaling relationships for strike-slip earthquakes in Myanmar based on the well-investigated coseismic fault rupture of two earthquake events in Myanmar: the 2011 Tarlay and 2012 Thabeikkyin earthquakes. We compare the relationship between the model parameters of the two earthquakes, namely the fault rupture areas (A), length (L), and slip rate (S), calculated using empirical scaling laws models with the estimated earthquake magnitude. The different maximum magnitudes resulting from the empirical scaling models suggest that using a proper scaling relationship is very important for estimating the maximum magnitude for strike-slip faults in Myanmar. This study demonstrates that earthquake magnitude from strike-slip faults in Myanmar is controlled by the fault rupture length and slip rate. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mount Sinabung was re-activated at August 28th, 2010 after a long repose interval. The early stage of a phreatic eruption was then followed by magmatic eruptions at September 15th, 2013 for years until now. To understand the ground surface changes accompanying the eruption periods, comprehensive analyses of surface and subsurface data are necessary, especially the condition in pre- and syn-eruption periods. This study is raised to identify ground surface and topographical changes before, intra, and after the eruption periods by analyzing the temporal signature of surface roughness, moisture, and deformation derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The time series of SAR backscattering intensity were analyzed prior to and after the early eruption periods to know the lateral ground surface changes including estimated lava dome roughness and surface moisture. Meanwhile, the atmospherically corrected Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) method was also applied to know the vertical topographical changes prior to the eruptions. The atmospheric correction based on modified Referenced Linear Correlation (mRLC) was applied to each D-InSAR pair to exclude the atmospheric phase delay from the deformation signal. The changes of surface moistures on syn-eruptions were estimated by calculating dielectric constant from SAR polarimetric mode following Dubois model. Twenty-one Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data on board Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and nine Sentinel-1A SAR data were used in this study with the acquisition date between February 2006 and February 2017. For D-InSAR purposes, the ALOS PALSAR data were paired to generate twenty interferograms. Based on the D-InSAR deformation, three times inflation-deflation periods were observed prior to the early eruption at August 28th 2010. The first and second inflation-deflation periods at the end of 2008 and middle 2009 presented migration of magma batches and dike generations in the deep reservoir. The third inflation-deflation periods in the middle of 2010 served as a precursor signal presenting magma feeding to the shallow reservoir. The summit was inflated about 1.4 cm and followed by the eruptions. The deflation of about 2.3 cm indicated the release pressure and temperature in the shallow reservoir after the early eruption at August 28th, 2010. The last inflation-deflation period was also confirmed by the increase of the lava dome roughness size from 5,121 m2 on July to 6,584 m2 on August. The summit then inflated again about 1.1 cm after the first eruption and followed by unrest periods presented by lava dome growth and destruction at September 15th, 2013. The volcanic products including lava and pyroclastics strongly affected the moisture of surface layer. The volcanic products were observed to reduce the surface moisture within syn-eruption periods. The hot materials are presumed responsible for the evaporation of the surface moisture as well. © IJOG - 2019.

AB  - The perpendicular distance and temporal difference of baselines are critical factors for determining the displacement accuracy of multi-temporal Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technique. This study aims to evaluate the capability of D-InSAR technique using large perpendicular and temporal baselines for measuring the ground displacement caused by tectonic movement and anthropogenic activity in the Bandung basin, West Java, Indonesia. Small baseline subset (SBAS) D-InSAR technique is adopted to clarify the spatio-temporal displacement pattern of the basin, and its accuracy is verified statistically using Pearson's correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error by comparing the estimated displacements with the displacement data by GPS. The results highlight two displacement patterns in the basin: anthropogenic-caused subsidence in the middle urban area and tectonic-caused uplift in the northern and southern parts around the faults. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Mt. Merapi, located in central Java, Indonesia, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. It has been subjected to numerous studies using a variety of methods, including tomographic imaging, in an attempt to understand the structure and dynamics of its magmatic plumbing system. Results of previous seismic tomographic studies that include Mt. Merapi poorly constrain the location of its underlying magma source due to limited data coverage. In order to comprehensively understand the internal structure and magmatism of Mt. Merapi, a project called DOMERAPI was conducted, in which 53 broadband seismic stations were deployed around Mt. Merapi and its neighbourhood for approximately 18 months, from October 2013 to April 2015. In this study, we compare Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs tomograms constructed using data obtained from local (DOMERAPI) and regional seismic networks with those obtained without DOMERAPI data. We demonstrate that the data from the DOMERAPI seismic network are crucial for resolving key features beneath the volcano, such as high Vp/Vs ratios beneath the Merapi summit at ∼5 km and ∼15 km depths, which we interpret as shallow and intermediate magma bodies, respectively. Furthermore, west-east vertical sections across Mt. Merapi, and a “dormant” (less active) volcano, Mt. Merbabu, exhibit high Vp/Vs and low Vp/Vs ratios, respectively, directly beneath their summits. This observation likely reflects the presence (for Mt. Merapi) and absence (for Mt. Merbabu) of shallow magma bodies near the surface. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Optical remote sensing data has been extensively used since early seventies for mapping and monitoring land cover. But, cloud cover has always been hindering the optimal use of the data, especially in the tropical and temperate regions. Because of cloud cover, researchers are forced to use only cloud free images or generate a composite using data from different dates to fill in the cloud and cloud-shadow areas. It is not a problem if the filling image is from the same season and from the same year. If there is large time gap between the acquisition date of image with the clouds and that of the filling image it will have an effect on classification accuracy. In this paper, we describe an approach in land cover classification of areas covered by cloud and cloud shadows. We use the synergy of optical image classification, processing of SAR data taking advantage of its ability of penetrating clouds, and decision rules using terrain parameters. We hypothesize that surface roughness of different land cover types derived from processing of SAR data and in combination with other topographic parameters (slope and elevation) can be applied to classify areas covered by clouds and cloud-shadows. The method was applied in a case study in Mts. Wayang-Windu and Patuha areas, near Bandung in West Java, Indonesia. Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS, Sentinel-1 A C band and SRTM DEM data of the study area were obtained. Initial classification of the optical data was carried out using training samples and fuzzy classification. Class labelling was done by applying fuzzy c-means algorithm. The Sentinel-1 A C band data was processed to get surface roughness. Decision boundaries for surface roughness, terrain slope and elevation were generated for each land cover type, which were implemented in the classification of the areas covered by cloud and cloud shadows. The result shows that it is possible to solve the problem of cloud cover using terrain parameters. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ground thermal anomalies associated with geothermal surface manifestations such as hot springs, fumaroles, altered surfaces, and steaming grounds serve as crucial indicator for geothermal explorations. In order to highlight the ground thermal anomalies, this study was raised to use the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data to estimate surface temperature under condition of dense vegetation. This study was focused to exploit the ASTER Thermal Infrared Radiometer (TIR) under lab and field scale conditions. The ASTER TIR bands were used to extract the Land Surface Temperature (Ts) from radiances by excluding surface emissivity (ϵs). The ϵ is a surface parameter dependent to the surface materials. In this paper, we demonstrated the performance of the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM) to calculate the Ts by estimating the ϵ under condition of dense vegetation. The Patuha and Wayang Windu Geothermal field in West Java (Indonesia) were selected as study site due to existence of surface manifestations under canopy vegetation and open area. According to the method, we identified that the ground thermal anomalies are located at surface manifestations. Due to the different spatial scales of satellite and surface measurements and the lack of homogeneous areas, which are representative for low resolution pixels and ground measurements, ground-validation is necessary. The consistency between ASTER data and location of geothermal manifestations indicated that thermal remote sensing data integrated with a spatial-based model, provides an effective means for identifying geothermal potential. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Currently, the European Space Agency (ESA) provides free and open access to Sentinel-1 data product. These satellite data have intensively improved the understanding and planning to mitigate the impacts of the geohazard phenomenon and ensure civil security. However, the application of InSAR data frequently limited by coherence loss caused by dense vegetation and extensive atmospheric artifacts. This paper presents a study of using C-Band Sentinel D-InSAR interferometry. The objective of this study was to mitigate the effects of vegetation and temporal decorrelation as well as improve the quality of the deformation pattern associated with Pidie Jaya earthquake on December 6, 2016. In this study, the descending orbits Sentinel-1A/B combined images product was used to generate a co-seismic interferogram. After coregistered the four images, a small part of the differential interference pattern obtained as a result of the land movement detected. The small part of fringes pattern appears in the coastal area. It was consistent with the field investigation. Unfortunately, the two sets of Sentinel-1 (S1A/S1B) combined product (revisit time of 12 days) used in this study was still not showing significant improvement incoherence. The results still showed similar deformation fringes when using two sets of S1A images (with the revisit time of 24 days). The highly speckled areas indicate the form of decorrelation arises, it may be due the dense vegetation area cause the properties of scatterers to vary over time (temporal decorrelation). Hence, further studies will be conducted using both ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provide great potential for ground surface mapping under canopy vegetation. The SAR observations regardless time and atmospheric condition are superior for mapping under torrid zones such as Indonesia. The ground surface parameters including surface roughness, moisture, and dielectric constant could be derived by SAR backscattering data. However, estimating thermal properties of ground surface based on SAR remote sensing is complicated because of sensor operation in microwave region. Meanwhile, the thermal properties of ground surface are crucial for estimating surface temperature originated from natural or anthropogenic sources such volcanic activity, urban area, forest fire, or steam spots. To identify the thermal signature from the SAR data, we performed laboratory experiments by incorporating thermal property of materials to be derived from SAR parameters. The experiments were performed by heating ground surface materials including altered rocks from geothermal field and peats from dense vegetation field. We measured moisture, electric potential, magnetic susceptibility, and permeability of the samples with variation of temperature. The measured temperature was controlled by thermal camera FLIR C2 and ground thermometer FLUKE 52 up to 250°C. According to the measurement, we identified that the moisture and electric potential of materials are decrease significantly at temperature more than 100°C. An interesting phenomenon could be reported that the magnetic susceptibility and permeability response to the altered rock and peat samples temperature similarly. The increasing temperature leads to decrease magnetic susceptibility and permeability in general. The mineral and organic content of the rocks and peats controlled their magnetic properties. The laboratory measurement results were then compared to the magnetic permeability derived-SAR backscattering data at a steam field of geothermal system. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) based on radar satellite data has emerged as a powerful technology for observing the Earth's surface, especially for monitoring the Earth's topography and deformations. However, it is well known that the InSAR measurements are often significantly affected by the atmosphere. This paper applies the pairwise logic (PWL) and the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technique using multitemporal SAR image from Sentinel-1A (S1A). The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of using PWL in reducing atmospheric delay and improve the results in capturing the deformation signal from the artifact. We stacked twelve pairs of S1A data before and after the December 6, 2016, Mw 6.5 Pidie Jaya earthquake in Aceh, Indonesia. Multitemporal interferograms of S1A in ascending and descending orbits were used to obtain Line of Sight (LOS) motion maps. To generate the differential interferogram of the PWL, then the first and the second interferogram were computed by summation process. Next, the second interferogram was added with the third, until the last interferogram of D-InSAR data pairs. The final data pair summation produced six pairwise interferogram. The results indicated that the summation of interferogram can increase the deformation twice in the line of sight of the satellite which represents movement toward or away from the satellite (e.g. uplift or subsidence), and also eliminated positive and negative signals in the line of sight velocities, which represent the atmospheric phase delay. The PWL simplified the complexity of atmospheric correction in the D-InSAR processing by reducing atmospheric artifact and increasing the deformation signal. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - It is important for seismic hazard management to conduct a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). In this study, focal mechanisms from the Harvard CMT catalog (1967 - 2013) were used to prepare a PSHA for Myanmar, located in one of the seismically active zones in Mainland Southeast Asia, by dividing them into shallow, intermediate and deep earthquake classes. The fault plane solutions of individual events were explored. Vertical profiles of five rectangular areas from North to West across Myanmar were developed to figure out the plate boundaries. We determined a- and b- values based on the seismicity of Myanmar from 1900 to 2016 taken from the earthquake catalogs of NEIC (USGS). The focal mechanisms of shallow and intermediate earthquakes are mostly strike slips and thrusts. However, the focal mechanisms of deep events give similar mechanisms, i.e. thrust faults with strike slip components. In this study, we aim to be able to estimate future earthquake potential in Myanmar. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Monitoring at every growth of rice plants is an important information for determining the grain pro-duction estimation of rice. Monitoring must to be have timely work on the rice plant development. However, timely monitoring and the high accuracy of information is a challenge in remote sensing based on rice agriculture monitoring and observation. With increased quality of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems utilizing polarimetric information recently, the development and applications of polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) are one of the current major topics in radar remote sensing. The ad-vantages provided by PolSAR data for agricultural monitoring have been extensively studied for applications such as crop type classification and mapping, crop phenology monitoring, productivity assessment based on the sensitivity of polarimetric parameters to indicators of crop conditions. Freeman and Durden successfully decomposed fully PolSAR data into three components: Single bounce, double bounce, and volume scattering. The three-component scattering provide features for distinguishing between different surface cover types. These sensitivities assist in the identification of growing phase. The observed growing phase development in time series, reflected in the consistent temporal trends in scattering, was generally in agreement with crop phenological development stages. Supervised classification was performed on repeat-pass Radarsat-2 images, with an overall classification accuracy of 77.27% achieved using time series Fine beam data. The study demonstrated that Radarsat-2 Fine mode data provide useful information for crop monitoring and classification of rice plants. © 2018 Institut Pertanian Bogor.

AB  - Selection of vegetation indices in plant mapping is needed to provide the best information of plant conditions. The methods used in this research are the standard deviation and the linear regression. This research tried to determine the vegetation indices used for mapping the sugarcane conditions around oil and gas fields. The data used in this study is Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The standard deviation analysis on the 23 vegetation indices with 27 samples has resulted in the six highest standard deviations of vegetation indices, termed as GRVI, SR, NLI, SIPI, GEMI and LAI. The standard deviation values are 0.47; 0.43; 0.30; 0.17; 0.16 and 0.13. Regression correlation analysis on the 23 vegetation indices with 280 samples has resulted in the six vegetation indices, termed as NDVI, ENDVI, GDVI, VARI, LAI and SIPI. This was performed based on regression correlation with the lowest value R2 than 0,8. The combined analysis of the standard deviation and the regression correlation has obtained the five vegetation indices, termed as NDVI, ENDVI, GDVI, LAI and SIPI. The results of the analysis of both methods show that a combination of two methods needs to be done to produce a good analysis of sugarcane conditions. It has been clarified through field surveys and showed good results for the prediction of microseepages. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Microseepages is one way to identify the existence of oil and gas below the surface of the earth. Identification of microseepages could be done using remote sensing approaches. One of the remote sensing data that can be used is Landsat 8. The purpose of this study is to map the potential of microseepages on the ground surface of Tugu Barat oil and gas field, North West Java Basin, Indonesia. The Landsat 8 data processing were performed including radiometric and geometric corrections, and vegetation indices calculation. The indices calculated in this study are Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (ENDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). Based on the vegetation indices, we detected that physical condition of vegetation anomaly served as microseepages location. The results showed that microseepages is identified in the south to the east of the oil and gas field presented by vegetation anomaly. Field survey confirmed the possibility of microseepages is located at yellowish leaf vegetation, high spectral of the leaf at the visible wavelength and low magnetic susceptibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Lineaments appearing on satellite images were used to characterize a regional fracture system. Manual extraction of lineaments is subjective and difficult to extend to a wide area because smaller lineaments may be overlooked. To increase the extraction accuracy of fracture-related lineaments and specify fractures that act as geothermal fluid paths with high permeability, this study adopts Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data because the backscattering intensities of SAR images can enhance small topographical reliefs relevant to fractures by using oblique microwave irradiation. We used two Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) images from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite with opposing irradiation directions to reduce the effect of topographic distortion caused by the oblique irradiation. Lineaments are extracted using the modified Segment Tracing Algorithm filtered by the Laplacian of Gaussian for linear features enhancement and noise removal. Surface geothermal features at the Wayang Windu geothermal field, West Java, Indonesia, were confirmed by comparing with soil pH, magnetic susceptibility, and surface roughness measurements. The calculated lineament distribution was spatially characterized by the intersection, occurrence frequency, and length densities of the lineaments. An ordinary kriging map of the lineament length density using 1 × 1-km cells showed good agreement with the geothermal surface features (hydrothermally altered zones, mud pools, and hot springs), which were probably formed by highly permeable fractures and fluid ascent. The high-anomaly zones of length density overlapped two fluid ascent sites and three water recharge sites in the water- and steam-dominated geothermal systems, respectively. © 2017

AB  - Current remote sensing technologies shows that surface manifestation of geothermal system could be detected with optical and SAR remote sensing, but to assess target beneath near the surface layer with the surficial method needs a further study. This study conducts a preliminary result using Optic and SAR remote sensing imagery to detect near surface geothermal manifestation at and around Mt. Papandayan, West Java, Indonesia. The data used in this study were Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS for delineating geothermal manifestation prospect area and an Advanced Land Observing Satellite(ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) level 1.1 for extracting lineaments and their density. An assumption was raised that the lineaments correlated with near surface structures due to long L-band wavelength about 23.6 cm. Near surface manifestation prospect area are delineated using visual comparison between Landsat 8 RGB True Colour Composite band 4,3,2 (TCC), False Colour Composite band 5,6,7 (FCC), and lineament density map of ALOS PALSAR. Visual properties of ground object were distinguished from interaction of the electromagnetic radiation and object whether it reflect, scatter, absorb, or and emit electromagnetic radiation based on characteristic of their molecular composition and their macroscopic scale and geometry. TCC and FCC composite bands produced 6 and 7 surface manifestation zones according to its visual classification, respectively. Classified images were then compared to a Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) to obtain the influence of vegetation at the ground surface to the image. Geothermal area were classified based on vegetation index from NDVI. TCC image is more sensitive to the vegetation than FCC image. The later composite produced a better result for identifying visually geothermal manifestation showed by detail-detected zones. According to lineament density analysis high density area located on the peak of Papandayan overlaid with zone 1 and 2 of FCC. Comparing to the extracted lineament density, we interpreted that the near surface manifestation is located at zone 1 and 2 of FCC image. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Remote sensing is one of the methods for geothermal exploration. This method can be used to map the geological structures, manifestations, and predict the geothermal potential area. The results from remote sensing were used as guidance for the next step exploration. Analysis of target in remote sensing is an efficient method to delineate geothermal surface manifestation without direct contact to the object. The study took a place in District Merangin, Jambi Province, Indonesia. The area was selected due to existing of Merangin volcanic complex composed by Mounts Sumbing and Hulunilo with surface geothermal manifestations presented by hot springs and hot pools. The location of surface manifestations could be related with local and regional structures of Great Sumatra Fault. The methods used in this study were included identification of volcanic products, lineament extraction, and lineament density quantification. The objective of this study is to delineate the potential zones for sitting the geothermal working site based on Thermal Infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. The lineament-related to geological structures, was aimed for high lineament density, is using ALOS - PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite - The Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) level 1.1. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis was used to predict the vegetation condition using Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS (The Operational Land Imager - Thermal Infrared Sensor). The brightness temperature was extracted from TIR band to estimate the surface temperature. Geothermal working area identified based on index overlay method from extracted parameter of remote sensing data was located at the western part of study area (Graho Nyabu area). This location was identified because of the existence of high surface temperature about 30°C, high lineament density about 4 - 4.5 km/km2 and low NDVI values less than 0.3. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A research using Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing have been conducted at Agung volcano to analyze the temporal thermal characteristics in the crater. We collected and identified the surface temperature of Agung volcano prolong prior and post eruptions in 2017-2018. The land surface temperature is one of the crucial parameters for observing volcanic activities by the occurrence of temperature change anomalies in the crater surface. We used the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) day and nighttime thermal infrared observations over Agung volcano for 18 years from February 2001 to July 2018. The surface temperature was obtained by Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) method. This method was also applied to reduce the effect of thermal inertia from the objects. According to the proposed method, the surface temperature of the ASTER nighttime observation at Agung volcano is 15 to 20°C in an intra-eruption period between 2001-2016. However, three months preceding the 21 November 2017 eruption, the maximum surface temperature at the summit increased to 34.93°C. Interestingly, the temperature decreased a week before the eruption to 28.41°C. Contrary, the highest surface temperature was obtained one day before the eruption on 28 June 2018 about 104.12°C. According to the visual interpretation of LANDSAT 8 image, a new incandescent lava extruded on 2 July 2018. Meanwhile, the ASTER daytime observed two weeks after the eruption of 25 November 2017 showed surface temperature at the summit about 105.99°C. The derived temporal surface temperature based on ASTER TIR provided prolong prior and post thermal signature to a new eruption phase of an active volcano. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

AB  - This paper presents the techniques for analyzing the topographical changes of the summit of AgungVolcano including crater morphology and volcanic ash coverage following the eruption based on Sentinel-1A data.Following dormant period for about 50 years, Agung volcano entered a new eruption phase, that is identified by fumaroleactivities in early November 2017, followed by a phreatic eruption at 21 November 2017 and magmatic eruption at 25November 2017, 24 December 2017, 11 January 2018, 11 March 2018, 28-29 June 2018, and 2 July 2018. Mitigationscenarios are necessary to prevent inevitable loss of thousand lives. Therefore, this study is raised to assist to decisionmaker especially for mapping the hazard near the summit correctly. To obtain the morphological change related to theeruptions, a topographical change detection technique is proposed using series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)remote sensing images. Polarimetric Decomposition method was selected to identify the properties of Agung Summitbased on SAR backscattering intensity measurement. The analyses were taken into account based on entropy (H) andalpha angle (a) produced by polarimetric backscattering decomposition. In addition, the optic sensor image from Sentinel2 was also used to clarify the results of polarimetric decomposition method. Then, the results of both images wereanalysed spatially and temporally. According to spatial and temporal analyses, the topographical change of AgungSummit could be detected because new volcanic products existed (e.g. lava flow and fumarole steam) inside and outsidethe crater. The lava flows were distributed mostly at western part in the crater rim about 20.251 ha. Meanwhile, fumarolesteam was distributed mostly at northern part in the crater rim about 13.216 ha. The temporal variation of volcanicproducts distribution could describe Agung Volcano eruption stages. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018.

AB  - Agung volcano located in the far east of Bali Island, Indonesia is one of the active volcanoes parts of Circum-Pacific ring of fire. Following the large eruption of 1963, the seismicity of Agung volcano increased significantly and put into alert level IV in September 22nd, 2017. Then, the early eruptions had occurred in November 25th and 26th, 2017. Regarding the eruptions, this research was aimed to observe the deformation series of Agung volcano from August 2017 to January 2018 using the atmospherically corrected Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) of multiplatform Sentinel-1A data. The D-InSAR techniques were commonly used for surface deformation monitoring by eliminating the topographical influence of the interferogram's phase. The Pairwise Logic Technique as termed as PLT was applied following the D-InSAR processing to eliminate atmospheric phase delay. The common image selection for D-InSAR pair served as the basis of the PLT. The method was adopted to Sentinel-1A data in ascending and descending orbits to observe the deformation change in Line-of-Sight (LOS). The deformation velocity was then calculated on the daily basis to omit the variation of temporal baseline. According to the PLT in ascending orbit, the surface velocity near the summit was calculated from-4.1 mm/day to 2.9 mm/day. The velocity obtained from the descending orbits was slightly different than the ascending orbit, from-2.5 mm/day to 3.6 mm/day due to different LOS orientation and time reference of the data. The deformation patterns formed from the deformation magnitude showed that the inflation occurred near the time of the eruption and the subsidence followed the eruption due to changes of pressure in the reservoir. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

AB  - In this paper, the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique is applied in order to investigate the ground deformation in and around two geothermal areas in West Java, Indonesia. Two time-series of ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1A acquisitions, covering the period from 2007 to 2009 and 2015–2016, are analysed. The first case study examines the Wayang Windu geothermal zone where the PS-InSAR analysis provides an overview of the surface deformation around a geothermal reservoir. Uplift is observed around the injection wells in the area. The second example involves the use of the PS-InSAR technique over a more recent geothermal system in Patuha field. Again, a pattern of uplift was observed around the only available injection well in the area. Due to the dense vegetation coverage of the geothermal areas in West Java, the longer wavelength ALOS PALSAR data is provides better results by identifying a larger number of PS points. Additionally, experiments have been carried out to compare the resulting deformation with another example of the fluid migration process i.e. water extraction in Bandung basin. The potential of sentinel-1A and ALOS PALSR data are compared in all the experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Geological mapping at volcanic terrain is crucial for providing accurate information related to the distribution of volcanic products and volcano-related structures. The volcano-geology map is basis information, not only for hazard mitigation related to volcanic activity, but also for resource exploration as well as scientific purposes. Therefore, the accurate detection and observation of volcanic products and their genetics are necessary for volcano-geology mapping. The classical problem at Torrid Zone such as cloud, dense vegetation, heavy weathering, and erosion usually hamper the detection and observation of volcanic products and their structures. Moreover, the stratigraphic of volcanic products generally follows paleotopography which was buried by the products. Overcoming the problem, we exploited the applicability of remotely sensed data to provide the great assistance for field based observations at volcanic field in Indonesia. The Geomorphologic and Structural Features (GSF) of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are the selected parameters to define the distribution of the volcanic products. We explained about the significant of SAR identification to detect and interpret volcano-geology parameters such as eruption centers, volcanic products, depositional mechanisms, and volcanic structures especially at complex of volcanoes. The fall and flowing mechanisms controlled the depositional process were also analyzed to obtain the genetic of volcanic products. For young volcanoes, the quantitative techniques based on SAR surface roughness and polarized signatures are effective to identify volcanic formations and their sources. However, for old volcanoes the visual analyses of GSF is superior to identify the volcanic units and structures. We selected two volcanic complexes at Mts. Guntur and Malabar in West Java (Indonesia) presenting the young and old volcanic field characteristics under Torrid Zone condition.

AB  - Rapid development of Surabaya City requires space for industry and settlement. The city development is followed by increasing of water demand for various purposes. Large amount of groundwater extraction may cause ground subsidence. According to groundwater extraction, we tried to delineate the possibility of aquifer potential based on ground surface deformation using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Electrical Resistivity methods. The InSAR is a method to estimate surface deformation in millimeter scale based on different phase of SAR data between acquisition times. In this paper, surface deformation combined with ground resistivity was used to analyse the potential of aquifer related to subsidence at Surabaya City, East Java, Indonesia. The Small Based Subset (SBAS) method was used to reduce phase delayed in the interferogram due to atmospheric condition. Based on the SBAS InSAR the deformation was detected at Surabaya City in January 2007 to February 2008. The largest and lowest deformation about 40 mm/year and about 0-10 mm/year were located in North to Southeastern and Western part of the city, respectively. The geodetic Global Positioning System (GPS) campaign in Surabaya confirmed that the detected deformation correlated with the ground subsidence with correlation coefficient about 0.96. To obtain the subsurface structures at subsidence zones, the Electrical Resistivity survey with Schlumberger configuration was performed in Surabaya city. According to the SBAS InSAR and subsurface resistivity, the subsidence around Pabeancantikan, Kenjeran, Simokerto and Tenggilismejoyo sub-districts agreed to high resistivity about 7-18 Ωm. The Sandstone of Kabuh and Pucangan formations in this area served as ground water aquifer which used by more than 200 wells. Ground water extraction probably triggered the subsidence at ground surface. The high resistivity at subsidence zones originated from high porosity of rocks served as aquifer with high groundwater extraction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Identifying distribution and stratigraphic of volcanic products are important not only for mitigating volcanic hazards, but also to know the characteristics of the successive eruptions. Guntur volcanic complex located in Garut, West Java, Indonesia was selected as study area because of the last eruption took place in 1847 and the volcanic activity has been dormant since then, however its seismicity is still active. During the period of July to October 2009, the hypocentre distribution of volcano tectonic earthquakes is mostly located at western flank of the volcano, beneath Guntur - Gandapura craters at the depth of less than 5 km. This study is aimed to identify distribution and succession of volcanic products based on their magnetic properties and backscattering signal of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. The polarimetric decomposition method was used to identify the distribution of the volcanic products based on their scattering characteristics. Then, the field measurement using SM-30 magnetic susceptibility meter was performed to confirm the units of volcanic products and interpret their successions. According to the polarimetric decomposition method, we could identify fifteen successive eruptions formed Guntur Volcano Complex and termed as Khuluk and Gumuk in Indonesian standard. The successions were produced Gumuk Windu, Gumuk Malang, Gumuk Pulus, Gumuk Putrri, Khuluk Meungpeuk, Gumuk Cakra, Gumuk Gandapura, Gumuk Putri, Gumuk Gajah, Gumuk Batususun, Khuluk Pasirlaku, Gumuk Agung, Gumuk Picung, Gumuk Pasirmalang, Gumuk Masigit, Khuluk Kabuyutan and Khuluk Guntur. The magnetic susceptibility confirmed that the variations of magnetic susceptibility of rocks at each gumuk agreed with their stratigraphy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Geological investigation by remote sensing using surface physical properties in tropical regions is challenging. To minimize the effects of atmosphere and vegetation in the obtained optical images, we used the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) onboard the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) was selected due to ability of the L-band to penetrate clouds and canopy vegetation. The polarimetric decomposition method based on Cloude-Pottier classification was used as the basis for backscattering analyses. The Ciseuti area in West Java, Indonesia was selected as the study site due to the existence of mining activities, including gold and galena mines. The identification is focused on the spatial distribution of prospected minerals regardless of cloud and vegetation canopy. The classified prospect zones could be extended using the Cloude- Pottier polarimetric decomposition into moderate random entropy and alpha double bounce scattering at argillic alterations, moderate random entropy and alpha surface scattering at intermediate argillic alterations, and highly moderate random entropy and alpha volume diffusion at advanced argillic alterations. The entropy and alpha extracted from ALOS PALSAR data based on Cloude-Pottier decomposition were very useful for identifying alteration zones. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Many geophysical methods at various scales have been applied to understand the internal structure beneath Merapi volcano and its magmatic process. As part of the DOMERAPI project, a seismic experiment was conducted from October 2013 to mid April 2015 in order to determine the deep magma source beneath the volcano through seismic travel-time tomography. The earthquake events were identified and picked manually and carefully to determine the hypocenters. They were then relocated to get precise hypocenter locations before running the seismic tomographic imaging. The data from the BMKG network from the same period of time as mentioned above were also incorporated to minimize azimuthal gap, because the majority of events occurred outside the DOMERAPI network. The checkerboard resolution test result depicts that the area around the network can be well resolved. Compared to previous studies, our result shows a higher resolution at shallow depths, i.e., less than 35 km and a low velocity material imaged to ascend diagonally from the deeper area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Merapi volcano located in central Java, Indonesia, is one of the most active stratovolcanoes in the world. Many Earth scientists have conducted studies on this volcano using various methods. The geological features around Merapi are very attractive to be investigated because they have been formed by a complex tectonic process and volcanic activities since tens of millions of years ago. The southern mountain range, Kendeng basin and Opak active fault located around the study area resulted from these processes. DOMERAPI project was conducted to understand deep magma sources of the Merapi volcano comprehensively. The DOMERAPI network was running from October 2013 to mid-April 2015 by deploying 46 broad-band seismometers around the volcano. Several steps, i.e., earthquake event identification, arrival time picking of P and S waves, hypocenter determination and hypocenter relocation, were carried out in this study. We used Geiger’s method (Geiger 1912) for hypocenter determination and double-difference method for hypocenter relocation. The relocation result will be used to carry out seismic tomographic imaging of structures beneath the Merapi volcano and its surroundings. For the hypocenter determination, the DOMERAPI data were processed simultaneously with those from the Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) seismic network in order to minimize the azimuthal gap. We found that the majority of earthquakes occurred outside the DOMERAPI network. There are 464 and 399 earthquakes obtained before and after hypocenter relocation, respectively. The hypocenter relocation result successfully detects some tectonic features, such as a nearly vertical cluster of events indicating a subduction-related backthrust to the south of central Java and a cluster of events to the east of Opak fault suggesting that the fault has an eastward dip. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - This study tried to monitor sugar cane condition surrounding of oil and gas field area. The spectral approaches were conducted for mapping sugar cane stress. As an initial stage Landsat-8 was corrected radiometrically and geometrically. Radiometric correction is an important stages for spectral approaching. Then all pixel values were transformed to the surface reflectance. Several vegetation indices were calculated to monitor vegetation stress surrounding of oil and gas field. NDVI, EVI, DVI, GVI, GRVI, GDVI and GNDVI were applied for generating tentative sugar cane stress images. The results indicated that sugar cane surrounding of oil and gas field has been influenced by oil and gas field. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Wayang -Windu Geothermal Field located in West Java, Indonesia is a geothermal field under tropical zone which is identified by high precipitation, dense vegetation, and extensive weathering/alteration. The clouds due to high precipitation and vegetation conditions on the tropical zone inhibit the identification of surface manifestation using optical remote sensing techniques. In this paper, we reduced these inhibiting factors using microwave remote sensing techniques termed as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The SAR dual orbits were used to observe the targets on the surface by minimizing the effects from the clouds and dense vegetation cover. This study is aimed to identify surface manifestation based on Geo morphologic and Structural Features (GSF) of the SAR in Ascending and Descending orbits. The Linear Features Density of SAR (lifedSAR) method was applied to quantify the linear features of the ground surface and served as basis of surface manifestation identification. Based on the lifedSAR and field observations, the surface manifestations could be detected succesfully at Wayang and Cibolang craters with density about 45%. The soil measurements were used validate the result and to interpret the correlation between LFD and surface manifestations.

AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing could be used to characterize targets at earth's surface based on their spectra. This capability is useful for mapping and characterizing the distribution of host rocks, alteration assemblages, and minerals. Contrary to the multispectral sensors, the hyperspectral identifies targets with high spectral resolution. The Wayang Windu Geothermal field in West Java, Indonesia was selected as the study area due to the existence of surface manifestation and dense vegetation environment. Therefore, the effectiveness of hyperspectral remote sensing in tropical region was targeted as the study objective. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method was used to detect the occurrence of clay minerals spatially from Hyperion data. The SAM references of reflectance spectra were obtained from field observation at altered materials. To calculate the effectiveness of hyperspectral data, we used multispectral data from Landsat-8. The comparison method was conducted by comparing the SAM's rule images from Hyperion and Landsat-8, resulting that hyperspectral was more accurate than multispectral data. Hyperion SAM's rule images showed lower value compared to Landsat-8, the significant number derived from using Hyperion was about 24% better. This inferred that the hyperspectral remote sensing is preferable for mineral mapping even though vegetation covered study area.

AB  - Mt. Wayang Windu is one of geothermal field located in West Java, Indonesia. The characterization of steam spots at surface manifestation zones based on the soil physical measurements of the area is presented in this study. The multivariate geostatistical methods incorporating the soil physical parameter data were used to characterize the zonation of geothermal surface manifestations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of spatial estimation method of multivariate geostatistics using Ordinary Cokriging (COK) to characterize the physical properties of geothermal surface manifestations at Mt. Wayang Windu. The COK method was selected because this method is favorable when the secondary variables has more number than the primary variables. There are four soil physical parameters used as the basis of COK method, i.e. Electrical Conductivity, Susceptibility, pH, and Temperature. The parameters were measured directly at and around geothermal surface manifestations including hot springs, fumaroles, and craters. Each location of surface manifestations was measured about 30 points with 30 x 30 m grids. The measurement results were analyzed by descriptive statistics to identify at the nature of data. The correlation among variables was analyzed using linear regression. When the correlation coefficient among variables is higher, the estimation results is expected to have better Linear Coregionalization Model (LCM). LCM was used to analyze the spatial correlation of each variable based on their variogram and cross-variogram model. In oder to evaluate the performance of multivariate geostatistical using COK method, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was performed. Estimation result using COK method is well applicable for characterizing the surface physics parameters of radar images data.

AB  - Geological structure observation is difficult to be conducted at Quaternary volcanic field due to the classical problem at tropical region such as intensive erosion, dense vegetation covers, and rough terrain. The problem hampers the field observation especially for geological structures mapping. In order to overcome the problems, an active remote sensing technology based on Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data was used in this study. The longer wavelength of microwave than optical region caused the SAR layer penetration higher than optics. The Ciwidey Geothermal Field, Indonesia was selected as study area because of the existence of surface manifestations with lack information about the control of geological structures to the geothermal system. Visual interpretation based on composite polarization modes was applied to identify geological structures at study area. The color composite Red-Green-Blue for HV-HH-VV polarizations provided highest texture and structural features among the other composite combination. The Linear Features Density (LFD) map was also used to interpret the fractures zones. The calculated LFD showed high anomaly about 3.6 km/km2 with two strike directions NW-SE and NE-SW. Interestingly, the surface geothermal manifestation agreed with the low anomaly of LFD. The geological structures consisted of ten faults were successfully detected and mapped. The faults type mainly are oblique-slip with strike directions NE-SW and NW-SE.

AB  - Geothermal explorations and productions are currently being intensively conducted at certain areas in Indonesia such as Wayang Windu Geothermal Field (WWGF) in West Java, Indonesia. The WWGF is located at wide area covering about 40 km2. An accurate method to map the distribution of heterogeneity minerals is necessary for wide areas such as WWGF. Mineral mapping is an important method in geothermal explorations to determine the distribution of minerals which indicate the surface manifestations of geothermal system. This study is aimed to determine the most precise and accurate methods for minerals mapping at geothermal field. Field measurements were performed to assess the accuracy of three proposed methods: 1) Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), utilizing the linear transformation method to eliminate the correlation among the spectra bands and to reduce the noise in the data, 2) Pixel Purity Index (PPI), a designed method to find the most extreme spectrum pixels and their characteristics due to end-members mixing, 3) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), an image classification technique by measuring the spectral similarity between an unknown object with spectral reference in n- dimension. The output of those methods were mineral distribution occurrence. The performance of each mapping method was analyzed based on the ground truth data. Among the three proposed method, the SAM classification method is the most appropriate and accurate for mineral mapping related to spatial distribution of alteration minerals.

AB  - Indonesia has about 40% of geothermal energy resources in the world. An area with the potential geothermal energy in Indonesia is Wayang Windu located at West Java Province. The comprehensive understanding about the geothermal system in this area is indispensable for continuing the development. A geothermal system generally associated with joints or fractures and served as the paths for the geothermal fluid migrating to the surface. The fluid paths are identified by the existence of surface manifestations such as fumaroles, solfatara and the presence of alteration minerals. Therefore the analyses of the liner features to geological structures are crucial for identifying geothermal potential. Fractures or joints in the form of geological structures are associated with the linear features in the satellite images. The Segment Tracing Algorithm (STA) was used for the basis to determine the linear features. In this study, we used satellite images of ALOS PALSAR in Ascending and Descending orbit modes. The linear features obtained by satellite images could be validated by field observations. Based on the application of STA to the ALOS PALSAR data, the general direction of extracted linear features were detected in WNW-ESE, NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE. The directions are consistent with the general direction of faults system in the field. The linear features extracted from ALOS PALSAR data based on STA were very useful to identify the fractured zones at geothermal field.

AB  - Microwave backscattering from the earth's surface depends on several parameters such as surface roughness and dielectric constant of surface materials. The two parameters related to water content and porosity are crucial for estimating soil moisture. The soil moisture is an important parameter for ecological study and also a factor to maintain energy balance of land surface and atmosphere. Direct roughness measurements to a large area require extra time and cost. Heterogeneity roughness scale for some applications such as hydrology, climate, and ecology is a problem which could lead to inaccuracies of modeling. In this study, we modeled surface roughness using Radasat-2 quad Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. The statistical approaches to field roughness measurements were used to generate an appropriate roughness model. This modeling uses a physical SAR approach to predicts radar backscattering coefficient in the parameter of radar configuration (wavelength, polarization, and incidence angle) and soil parameters (surface roughness and dielectric constant). Surface roughness value is calculated using a modified Campbell and Shepard model in 1996. The modification was applied by incorporating the backscattering coefficient (σ°) of quad polarization HH, HV and VV. To obtain empirical surface roughness model from SAR backscattering intensity, we used forty-five sample points from field roughness measurements. We selected paddy field in Indramayu district, West Java, Indonesia as the study area. This area was selected due to intensive decreasing of rice productivity in the Northern Coast region of West Java. Third degree polynomial is the most suitable data fitting with coefficient of determination R2 and RMSE are about 0.82 and 1.18 cm, respectively. Therefore, this model is used as basis to generate the map of surface roughness.

AB  - The Toba Caldera formed from large depression of Quaternary volcanism is a remarkable feature at the Earth surface. The last Toba super eruptions were recorded around 73 ka and produced the Youngest Toba Tuff about 2,800 km3. Since then, there is no record of significant volcanic seismicity at Toba Volcanic Complex (TVC). However, the hydrothermal activities are still on going as presented by the existence of hot springs and alteration zones at the northwest caldera. The hydrothermal fluids probably containing some chemical compositions mixed with surficial water pollutant and contaminated the Toba Lake. Therefore, an environmental issues related to the existence of chemical composition and degradation of water clearness in the lake had been raised in the local community. The pollutant sources are debatable between natural and anthropogenic influences because some human activities grow rapidly at and around the lake such as hotels, tourisms, husbandry, aquaculture, as well as urbanization. Therefore, obtaining correct information about the source materials floating at the surface of the Toba Lake is crucial for environmental and hazard mitigation purposes. Overcoming the problem, we presented this paper to assess the source possibility of floating materials at Toba Lake, especially from natural sources such as hydrothermal activities of TVC and river stream sediments. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) techniques using atmospherically corrected of Landsat-8 and colour composite of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) were used to map the distribution of floating materials. The seven ground truth points were used to confirm the correctness of proposed method. Based on the SAM and PolSAR techniques, we could detect the interface of hydrothermal fluid at the lake surfaces. Various distributions of stream sediment were also detected from the river mouth to the lake. The influence possibilities of the upwelling process from the bottom floor of Toba Lake were also discussed in view point magmatism beneath TVC. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - Analysis of hazard assessment to active volcanoes is crucial for risk management. The hazard map of volcano provides information to decision makers and communities before, during, and after volcanic crisis. The rapid and accurate hazard assessment, especially to an active volcano is necessary to be developed for better mitigation on the time of volcanic crises in Indonesia. In this paper, we identified the hazard parameters to develop quantitative and dynamic hazard map of an active volcano. The Guntur volcano in Garut Region, West Java, Indonesia was selected as study area due population are resided adjacent to active volcanoes. The development of infrastructures, especially related to tourism at the eastern flank from the Summit, are growing rapidly. The remote sensing and field investigation approaches were used to obtain hazard parameters spatially. We developed a quantitative and dynamic algorithm to map spatially hazard potential of volcano based on index overlay technique. There were identified five volcano hazard parameters based on Landsat 8 and ASTER imageries: volcanic products including pyroclastic fallout, pyroclastic flows, lava and lahar, slope topography, surface brightness temperature, and vegetation density. Following this proposed technique, the hazard parameters were extracted, indexed, and calculated to produce spatial hazard values at and around Guntur Volcano. Based on this method, the hazard potential of low vegetation density is higher than high vegetation density. Furthermore, the slope topography, surface brightness temperature, and fragmental volcanic product such as pyroclastics influenced to the spatial hazard value significantly. Further study to this proposed approach will be aimed for effective and efficient analyses of volcano risk assessment. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - Detecting ground surface changes at active volcanoes is crucial for better hazard mitigation. Ground based measurements are commonly used to detect surface changes especially on the flanks near to the summit. However, the selection of observation points is limited by field conditions such as rough terrain and topographical barrier. The few number of observation points may lead to miss-interpretation when the displacements related to magma ascent occurred beneath unobserved flanks. This classical problem is common for dormant volcanoes. Overcoming the problem, we used the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to observe surface roughness changes at the summit of active volcanoes. This paper discussed the potential capability of the SAR backscattering intensity to observe ground surface changes in view point of surface roughness around the summit. We presented two study cases at Mt. Sinabung in North Sumatra and Mt. Merapi in Central Java - Indonesia. Mt. Merapi was selected for comparison following published references. Mt. Sinabung is currently active since the first phreatic eruption has been occurred in August 2010. Time series of lava dome roughness on SAR (drSAR) method were used to detect ground surface changes prior to the eruption. Based on this method, the ground surface at the summit of Mt. Sinabung changed from 5121 to 6584 m2. The temporal pattern slightly agreed to the ground surface changes at summit of Mt. Merapi prior to the 2010 eruptions. Observing ground surface changes related to surface roughness at the summit might be used as new tools for observing volcanic activity. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Dielectric permittivity ε<inf>r</inf> measured on the Earth's surface is an effective property for characterizing surface materials in terms of rock type and water content, particularly in highly changeable environments such as active volcanoes. We propose a technique termed dielectric permittivity from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (dPSAR) to quantify ε<inf>r</inf> using a single scene of polarimetric SAR data, based on the small perturbation model of backscattering (SPMB). For an optimal solution, the Nelder-Mead simplex method was combined with SPMB. The application of dPSAR to a scene of ALOS PALSAR data from the vicinity of Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, correctly identified the relative value ranges of ε<inf>r</inf> for pyroclastic flow and tephra deposits accompanying large eruptions that occurred on November 5, 2010; their means were 2.55 and 3.07, respectively. Pore water within porous ashes is a plausible factor for increases in the ε<inf>r</inf> of the tephra. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Indonesia contains 27 active volcanoes passing the West through the East part. Therefore, Indonesia is the most hazard front due to the volcanic activities. To obtain the new precursory signals leading to the eruptions, we applied remote sensing technique to observe ground surface change series at the summit of Sinabung and Kelud volcanoes. Sinabung volcano is located at Karo Region, North Sumatra Province. This volcano is a strato volcano type which is re-activated in August 2010. The eruption continues to the later years by ejecting volcanic products such as lava, pyroclastic flow, and ash fall deposits. This study is targeted to observe ground surface change series at the summit of Sinabung volcano since 2007 to 2011. In addition, we also compared the summit ground surface changes after the eruptions of Kelud volcano in 2007. Kelud volcano is also strato volcano type which is located at East Java, Indonesia. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remotely sensed technology makes possible to observe rapidly a wide ground surface changes related to ground surface roughness. Detection series were performed by extracting the backscattering intensity of the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). The intensity values were then calculated using a Normalized Radar Cross-Section (NRCS). Based on surface roughness criterion at the summit of Sinabung volcano, we could observe the ground surface changes prior to the early eruption in August 2010. The continuous increment of NRCS values showed clearly at window size 3×3 pixel of the summit of Sinabung volcano. The same phenomenon was also detected at the summit of Kelud volcano after the 2007 eruptions. The detected ground surface changes were validated using optical Landsat-8, backscattering intensity ratio for volcanic products detection, and radial component of a tilt-meter data. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - Understanding precursory signals is essential to forecast eruptions hazards and mitigate risks. Satellite observations have been shown to increasingly contribute to this goal. We use Differential-Inteferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) and SAR backscattering intensity data from ALOS/PALSAR to define a time-series of ground surface displacements for the 2006-2010 inter-eruptive period at Merapi volcano. We correlate trends in the displacement data to trends for summit temperature (determined using data from the ASTER sensor) and to gas emission data. We show that processing of the satellite data must be performed carefully before meaningful interpretations can be drawn. For example, after careful removal of the topographic effect on phase delays, we detect only subtle inter-eruptive episodes of cyclic deformation in the D-InSAR and SAR backscattering data. These small (mostly sub-centimeter) displacements contrast with meter-scale pre-eruptive displacements along an electronic distance measurement (EDM) line on the south flank of the volcano. We suggest that this difference is a consequence of localized movement within the summit area - a result that has important implications for understanding Merapi's structure, for monitoring network design and for eruption forecasting. Although small, Merapi's inter-eruptive deformation cycles are also seen in thermal data from ASTER and gas emissions. Accordingly, we interpret these cycles as the result of successive movement of individual magma batches migrating upward from deeper to shallower storage systems located along a NE dipping conduit. In view of magma migration prior to eruptions, these cycles may also serve as a precursory signal for large eruptions at Merapi, such as the one that took place in early November 2010. © 2013.

AB  - In the last decades, remote sensing technology were facing problem to identify ground surface under tropical region. The clouds and thick vegetation always became an obstacle for remote sensing sensor to reveal surface geology feature. Therefore, the benefit of satellite data for geology exploration as well as hazard mitigation might be less effective. Nowadays, remote sensing technology seems to be approaching a new era in the use of microwave region onboard space borne termed as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor. In contrast with optical sensor, the SAR satellite generates its own signal in microwave frequency and receives the back-scattering intensity from material at surface, the sensor works regardless time acquisition and clouds cover especially at low frequency. In this paper, we present our achievements in the use of SAR sensor especially at C and L-band frequencies for geological explorations. The effectiveness of fusion data to detect the alteration zones and fluid paths of geothermal system were discussed, respectively. The capability of PolarimetricSAR to detect rock type distribution at active volcanoes was also explained even though ash and smoke covered the summit. We present the significant results for: (1) mapping alteration zones; (2) quantifying geological structures; and (3) identifying rock type distribution. The ground check and published data are always used for validating our result.

AB  - An understanding of the geomorphology and distribution of surface materials on an active volcano is crucial to characterize eruptions and mitigate volcanic hazards. For volcanoes, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is the only useful observation and monitoring technology that can be undertaken in any weather condition. This letter uses the data from one type of airborne SAR system termed polarimetric and interferometric airborne SAR and L-band microwaves to classify SAR imagery into geomorphologic units, based on a scattering mechanism, using the example of Mt. Sakurajima, a representative active volcano situated in southern Japan. This is accomplished by adopting a Bayesian decision classification (BDC) scheme applied to two polarimetric parameters, namely, entropy and the type of scattering mechanism, which are derived from Cloude-Pottier decomposition of full polarimetry. In spite of the thick vegetation cover, BDC can divide SAR imagery from Mt. Sakurajima into three geomorphologic units: volcanic cone, terrace, and foot. The suitability of the BDC classification of microwave sensor imageryand its superiority over a traditional classification scheme, the K-means unsupervised classificationis confirmed by polarimetric signature analysis and ground-truth surveying that directly quantifies surface scattering. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding precursory signal leading to a large and explosive eruption, such as Merapi eruption in 2010, is the key to a successful hazard assessment in the future. Towards resolution of this problem, time series of Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) of ALOS/PALSAR data together with thermal radiance at summit area were analyzed to characterize magmatic process. The D-InSAR could detect deformation changes in between two eruption episodes of Merapi in 2006 and 2010. The maximum uplifting rate ∼0.7 mm/day is observed twice: two years and one month before eruption in October 26, 2011. The first uplift is related to magma ascent and the later is precursory to an imminent eruption. Thermal radiance of ASTER data not only served as indicator on the arrival of fresh magma near the surface, but also to confirm whether or not the deformation signal is related to the imminent eruption. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Forty-six deep groundwater samples from highly arsenic affected areas in Bangladesh were analyzed in order to evaluate the processes controlling geochemical constituents in the deep aquifer system. Spatial trends of solutes, geochemical modeling and principal component analysis indicate that carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering and ion exchange control the major-ion chemistry. The groundwater is dominantly of Na-Cl type brackish water. Approximately 17% of the examined groundwaters exhibit As concentrations higher than the maximum acceptable limit of 10μg/L for drinking water. Strong correlation (R2=0.67) of Fe with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and positive saturation index of siderite suggests that the reductive dissolution of Fe-oxyhydroxide in presence of organic matter is considered to be the dominant process to release high content of Fe (median 0.31mg/L) in the deep aquifer. In contrast, As is not correlated with Fe and DOC. Boron concentration in the 26% samples exceeds the standard limit of 500μg/L, for water intended for human consumption. Negative relationships of B/Cl ratio with Cl and boron with Na/Ca ratio demonstrate the boron in deep groundwater is accompanied by brackish water and cation exchange within the clayey sediments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, is one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes in the Torrid Zone. This volcano has erupted frequently and has produced pyroclastic flows following the collapse of the summit lava dome. We used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by JERS-1 and RADARSAT-1 satellites from April 1996 to July 2006 to clarify the distribution patterns of the pyroclastic flow deposits. The extent of the deposits, termed P-zones, was accurately extracted by ratio operation and low-level feature extraction from SAR intensity images. These images highlighted temporal changes of the distribution area, perimeter, flow distance, included angle, and collapse direction. To validate the image-processing results, reflectance spectra of the rock samples collected after the eruption in June 2006 were measured in a laboratory. The reflectance spectra of all samples showed similar characteristics to the reference spectra, which were derived from atmospheric correction of Hyperion sensor image data covering the lava dome at the summit. Therefore, P-zones were confirmed to be the pyroclastic flow deposits originating from destruction of the lava dome at the summit. The image-processing results clarified that the extent of the distribution areas, perimeter, flow distances, and included angle of the P-zones were variable among the eruptions, while the collapse direction had a constant pattern. The collapse pattern followed a clockwise change from the south toward the west. By comparing the ratio maps of Bouguer gravity anomaly data in two periods, the change was interpreted to originate from the inclination of the conduit and the formation of shallow and deep magma reservoirs. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Merapi eruption is characterized by the persistent growth of a summit dome and partial or total collapse of the dome to generate hot pyroclastic flows. In this paper, we aim at detecting the latest pyroclastic flows deposit and assessing its possibility to generate lahars during and after rainy season. We used RADARSAT SAR scenes and ASTER images acquired on the dates soon after the eruption. The analysis of two type image data proved the high capability of detecting the small-scale volcanic flows in spite of the bad atmospheric condition. The RADARSAT SAR scattering intensity changes through beta nought calculation for SLC product before and after the eruption, and the classifications using NDVI threshold methods were applied to delineate the pyroclastic flows and lahars distribution. Moving image calculation was also adopted to simulate vector of lahars flow direction. The results deduced that the coverage of lahars deposit changed from parental pyroclastic deposits was about 5.5 km2. The lahars commonly flowed towards the SE-SW direction and elongated more than 10 km. The lahars flow from the nearest height topography to the lower part with gathering and filling the river banks. This study can be effective for environment and hazard assessments associated with pyroclastic flows and lahars after the eruption.
